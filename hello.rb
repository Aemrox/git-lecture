# some tips
# When you get stuck on comitting  a change without a message,
# you get sucked into VIM or another default text editor
#
# To get out of VIM, hit ESC a few times then click :q!

# getting out of the weird less format that git uses (I.E. (END)) just type
# q - only q - and it will get you out


# git diff allows you to see the difference between different versions in your repo
#
# git reset allows you to unstage changes before you commit
# git reset HEAD to unstage deleted stuff
