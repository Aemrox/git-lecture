# some GIT tips
# When you get stuck on comitting  a change without a message,
# you get sucked into VIM or another default text editor
#
# To get out of VIM, hit ESC a few times then click :q!

# getting out of the weird less format that git uses (I.E. (END)) just type
# q - only q - and it will get you out


# git diff allows you to see the difference between different versions in your repo
#
# git reset allows you to unstage changes before you commit
# git reset HEAD to unstage deleted stuff
NOW I'm taking notes through the terminal
WOAH

When you stage a change for commit, you put the people in the frame,
commit is taking the picture

git log is how you check out all of your commits

git remote add origin git@github.com:Aemrox/git-lecture.git is how you create
a new remote repository when you need to create it for the first timed
git push -u origin master to push something to the remote directory

This is me trying to update the remote
